# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Core library code lives in `surrogate_ccm/`. Key subpackages are `ccm/` for embedding and cross-mapping, `surrogate/` for null-model generators, `generators/` for coupled systems, `experiments/` for runnable study modules, `testing/` for statistical inference helpers, and `visualization/` for plotting. Use `run_experiments.py` as the main CLI entry point. Keep reusable experiment settings in `configs/*.yaml`, and long-form documentation in `docs/`. Root-level `ccm.py` and `system.py` are standalone advanced utilities. Generated outputs belong in `results/`, which is gitignored.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install the package in editable mode with `python -m pip install -e .`. Install developer extras with `python -m pip install -e .[dev]`. Run a fast validation pass with `python run_experiments.py --experiment robustness --config configs/smoke_test.yaml`. Run a targeted study with `python run_experiments.py --experiment surrogate --config configs/method_comparison.yaml`. For full runs, use `python run_experiments.py --experiment all --config configs/full_experiment.yaml --n-jobs 16`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.9+ and follow the existing code style: 4-space indentation, `snake_case` for modules, functions, and YAML files, and `PascalCase` for classes such as `SECCM`. Keep imports grouped as standard library, third-party, then local. Prefer short NumPy-style docstrings for public functions and numerically sensitive logic. No formatter or linter is checked in, so match surrounding style before introducing structural changes.

## Testing Guidelines
`pytest` and `pytest-cov` are available through the `dev` extra, but this repository currently relies heavily on smoke and experiment validation. For algorithm changes, run the smallest relevant config first, usually `configs/smoke_test.yaml` or `configs/quick_validation.yaml`. When adding automated tests, use `pytest` naming like `tests/test_embedding.py` and keep numerical tests deterministic by fixing seeds and asserting tolerances explicitly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history favors short, imperative commit messages, often with optional prefixes such as `fix:`, `docs:`, or `config:`. Examples: `fix: standardize experiment failure handling` and `docs: update README ...`. Keep commits single-purpose. PRs should summarize the affected modules, list the configs or commands used for validation, and include representative figures or output paths when plots, tables, or docs change. If you update user-facing behavior, sync `README.md` and `docs/README_zh.md` when relevant.
